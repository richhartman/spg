                <p>A belated Merry Christmas, and earlier Happy Birthday to yours truly. It has been a great year, and as a Christmas present, we have been visited upon since 2021 by a new and devout member, Pregador, and boy does he have some Christmas presents for us! As well as fishing up enormous amounts of old content we had been in search of, he has also gifted us with some cool tools for finding SFX, MIDIs and fixing broken links and games! With this, the site has been given a major overhaul and fixes ahoy! Go check out the misc page too, whilst you're at it, and don't get too shitfaced on New Year's Eve!</p><small>IngramJ</small>

                <p>Man, SSL problems and lack of activity suck. But hey, not all is lost. Our Discord has seen quite a rise in activity these last few months, including from one ua8fb, with his RPG Maker SPG, 'South Park: Quest for the Holy Thong!' Inspired by the two offical retail SPGs (The Stick of Truth and The Fractured But Whole) If you're interested, you should definitely check out his progress in his server here, he may resurrect SPG yet! https://discord.gg/R2VgkJQukq ...Oh yeah, and Kenny's Rampage: Kyle's Journey creator Matthias Eriksson also popped by for a brief reunion.</p><small>IngramJ</small>

                <p>Six months since the last update! The joys of adulthood and a nostalgic community, eh? Not all bad though, we just found our good ol' pal Stanimation! ...Still no sign of Bunni though... With his return, I present to you another drunken livestream from May 7! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GbhRSTU6s4&amp;t=4095s Also, some new screenshots and broken links are being fixed as I speak. 'Til next time! ...Also, RFI has been tracking down Smacko who was last seen playing as a druid in Stormwind.

                <p>Well would ya look at that? A whole 'nother year has gone by. Old friends and new ones have come to visit at the group Discord since none of us can communicate over the AIM these days. Added a handful of new games thanks to the help of our pals over at Kliktopia and the archivists at Archive.org. Still waiting for the day Beamer Games returns to take admin of this delightful service. Until then: Happy Holidays and Over n Out!</p><small>RFI</small>

                <p>The Games listing of this wholesome website has been mostly finished now sporting a description and set of screenshots for each game. Please check it out. When you're done, come visit us in our delightful Discord community group. Many more things are in store here at SPG but without any particular time frame. Until then: Over n Out!</p><small>RFI</small>
