                <p>A belated Merry Christmas, and earlier Happy Birthday to yours truly. It has been a great year, and as a Christmas present, we have been visited upon since 2021 by a new and devout member, Pregador, and boy does he have some Christmas presents for us! As well as fishing up enormous amounts of old content we had been in search of, he has also gifted us with some cool tools for finding SFX, MIDIs and fixing broken links and games! With this, the site has been given a major overhaul and fixes ahoy! Go check out the misc page too, whilst you're at it, and don't get too shitfaced on New Year's Eve!</p><small>IngramJ</small>

                <p>Man, SSL problems and lack of activity suck. But hey, not all is lost. Our Discord has seen quite a rise in activity these last few months, including from one ua8fb, with his RPG Maker SPG, 'South Park: Quest for the Holy Thong!' Inspired by the two offical retail SPGs (The Stick of Truth and The Fractured But Whole) If you're interested, you should definitely check out his progress in his server here, he may resurrect SPG yet! https://discord.gg/R2VgkJQukq ...Oh yeah, and Kenny's Rampage: Kyle's Journey creator Matthias Eriksson also popped by for a brief reunion.</p><small>IngramJ</small>

                <p>Six months since the last update! The joys of adulthood and a nostalgic community, eh? Not all bad though, we just found our good ol' pal Stanimation! ...Still no sign of Bunni though... With his return, I present to you another drunken livestream from May 7! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GbhRSTU6s4&amp;t=4095s Also, some new screenshots and broken links are being fixed as I speak. 'Til next time! ...Also, RFI has been tracking down Smacko who was last seen playing as a druid in Stormwind.

                <p>Well would ya look at that? A whole 'nother year has gone by. Old friends and new ones have come to visit at the group Discord since none of us can communicate over the AIM these days. Added a handful of new games thanks to the help of our pals over at Kliktopia and the archivists at Archive.org. Still waiting for the day Beamer Games returns to take admin of this delightful service. Until then: Happy Holidays and Over n Out!</p><small>RFI</small>

                <p>Welcome to the newest rendition of South Park Gaming, a historical project aimed at archiving all of the fan-made freeware parody games based on the Comedy Central television series South Park. The South Park Gaming community started around 1999 and lasted until 2009. We welcome members old and new.</p><small>RFI</small>

                <p style="margin-bottom:0px;">Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:13px;">At this time, the merging black holes appear to be no closer to each other than they were thirteen years ago. Safe to say, we may disregard this threat.&nbsp; I have decided to resurrect this community despite potentially challenges the will arise. To quote former U.S. President, John F. Kennedy;</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:13px;">&nbsp;“Those who dare to fail miserably can achieve greatly.”</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:13px;">&nbsp;Unfortunately, Kennedy also said: “Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future.”</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:13px;">Understanding the balance of risk and reward, there are&nbsp; several goals I wish to achieve with the creation of this message board.&nbsp; &nbsp;First and foremost: "If you build it, he will come."&nbsp; This is a line from the 1989 Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams which I never saw. Having said that, most people remember the line as “They will come.” In our original efforts to round up those that remain of the South Park Gaming (SPG) community, we were able to attempt to reconnect with those whom we remember and could track down via old emails and screen-names. This message board will serve as a centralized hub where old members may find us.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:13px;">Secondly, and perhaps more important that the first reason listed, this community comes to serve as a huge dose of nostalgia as well as historically archive the era of SPG. Nostalgia alone often comes as a great source of entertainment for those of us at any age. And I have said this<br> before: As nostalgia is often a fleeting feeling, I wish I had a viable way to capture it, distill it to its purest form, then crush it up and snort it. Seeing as I am still in the research and development phase of whether or not such a prospect will ever be possible, this community will supplement those desires in the interim.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:13px;">Lastly, in the effort to rebuild a once great community that spawned in the chaos of the old internet, this forum serves to help lead and direct from both a project management standpoint as well as a social standpoint. While Discord may serve as a worthy tool as a chat room through both text and talk, it lacks the structure and longevity of a traditional forum. Different boards/threads will allow us the organization necessary in order to do what humans like to do best: Share stories, ideas, and work collectively on projects we are most passionate about.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:13px;">Having listed the primary reasons for wishing to build this community, I will now explain the risks: SPG, while at its heart, has always been a game-development community. In this current time in history (20 years later) the entire game-development industry is flooded with developers and anyone and their mother is developing games for this device or another. Combine this zeitgeist with the fact that SPG has always been based on parody games of the television series South Park (One of the reasons our games became as renowned as they were back in the day) it has always left us with a very niche community. This leaving us with the challenge that we will always be a small community no matter how big of an audience our games receive.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:13px;">Nothing worthwhile was ever easy. Having said that, I welcome you all to the South Park Gaming Community, members old and new. &nbsp;To briefly introduce myself, I am RFI. (An abbreviation for Realistic Freak Infection. Hey, I was in high school and I thought it was cool and edgy. Plus, it was a play on another name at the time) I originally joined the community in 2002 although I had created a few (terrible) games in 2000. I served as Admin in my senior year of high school in<br> 2006 and a few years proceeding under the command of Beamer. I will list more details on myself in the “Introduce Yourself” thread. For now, please enjoy your stay.</p><small>RFI</small>
