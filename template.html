                <p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">Beamer was one of the longest-running contributors to the South Park Gaming community and one of the administrators through most of the era. Working alongside Junkman, he managed to create the largest online repository of South Park games. It was through Beamer's persistent leadership style and ongoing contributions that the community managed to hold together even through a steady decline in member activity in the last years of SPG.</span></p><small>Games</small><a class="fw-light" href="previous.html" style="padding-left:13px;">

                <p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">IngramJ was a humungous South Park and South Park Gaming fan who naively joined the communitys in 2005 at age 12, and was quickly banned. However, he was later forgiven due to his atonements through his contributions, usually in the forms of spritesheets and SPGtv shows, along with some relatively unknown games. These days creates YouTube Poops and Hitler Rants Parodies with the handle WonkyTonkBotty, and sometimes makes Macromedia Flash animations often under the influence of heavy metal music and cheap alcohol.</span></p><small>Games</small><a class="fw-light" href="previous.html" style="padding-left:13px;">

                <p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">RFI was a lurker in the early years of the South Park Gaming community citing he was too young to know about messageboards at the end of the 1990s. Despite this, his early games (created under the name Xplicit) managed to make their way into the community where they were shared on various websites. In 2002, with the help of Beamer, RFI was initiated into the community where he became a prominent contributor showing promising style in his games. He also contributed several MIDIs to other game developers and became administrator for the SPG Archives website in 2006 until 2008.</span></p><small>Games</small><a class="fw-light" href="previous.html" style="padding-left:13px;">
