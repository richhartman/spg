                <p>As a rabid South Park fanatic from the age of 10 (2003), IngramJ&nbsp;was lead to the SPG world when his father showed him some of the&nbsp;games; namely, Avenging Kenny's Death (Korobrown Software) and South Park Invaders (Matt Crosta). From there, as a nerdy shut-in (at the time), Ingram dived down the rabbit hole and had zilch&nbsp;desire to climb back out.&nbsp;</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row" style="padding-bottom:8px;width:650px;max-width:650px;">
            <div class="col-md-11 col-lg-8" style="width:720px;">
                <p style="margin-bottom:13px;">As his love of these games grew, he was led to both The Games Factory and Smiley Town Arcade, wherein he&nbsp;awkwardly but slowly learned the ropes with Clickteam, and found&nbsp;the main community crash; then of course, as STA closed, he followed to SPGA, and regularly browsed the forums from 2004 to the very&nbsp;beginning of 2005.</p>
                <p>Young at heart, unhinged, uninhibited and unfazed by the "rules", IngramJ both blessed and cursed SPG with his presence a bit later than most in 2005, and certainly made an impression, between being so inexperienced with forum etiquette he initially got himself exiled, only to be re-welcomed after redeeming himself with his contributions to the community, and making an alt-account for trolling purposes.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:13px;">Creator of several well-received sprite sheets and other graphical works, some demos that didn't go anywhere, and one of the most successful SPGtv shows, "The Thickest Sh**", in his free time, Ingram is an adrenaline junkie, self-taught Flash animator, FX editor by handle "WonkyTonkBotty", religious metalhead and puts 1000% effort into everything he does, inspired by Grant Cardone's 10x rule... that includes replacing Rumney as SPG's British alcoholic.</p>

                <p style="text-align:left;">Hailing from Birmingham, he also loves traveling, especially the Northern regions of Scotland. Oh yeah, he alongside RFI was also partly responsible for resurrecting the community to what it is today, and keeps the life of the party going by irregularly streaming SPGs drunk.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:13px;">RFI is still waiting for IngramJ to visit him in Chicago.&nbsp; Ingramj may get murdered but the deep dish pizza and hotdogs will be to die for.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:13px;">In his free-time, when he's not working full-time as an apprentice electrical engineer, and part-time as a gym-instructor AND porter/bartender of a wedding venue, Ingram loves long-distance driving, extreme sports, making "Downfall Parodies" and "YouTube Poops" of British author/poet Michael Rosen on YouTube, and is an experienced flash animator. In fact,&nbsp;at the beginning of 2006, he became a regular of iconic cartoon/game site Newgrounds, where he made Flash and joined the infamous "Clock Crew" until around 2009.</p>
                <p>He now works with Sony Vegas to edit videos mentioned above, and is also modding for Guitar Hero World Tour: Definitive Edition. He is also a multi-instrumentalist, able to play the keyboard, 6-string guitar, bass guitar and drums to varying degrees of talent. Believe it or not, despite some of these hobbies being on the nerdy side of things, Ingram is also somewhat of a "jock", as he regularly hits the gym with his best friend 3-4 times a week, and is also fond of 10ks and half-marathons.</p><small>Favorite Food: Anything chicken, pasta, or salami. And alcohol, of course.</small>
