                <p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">Beamer was one of the longest-running contributors to the South Park Gaming community and one of the administrators through most of the era. Working alongside Junkman, he managed to create the largest online repository of South Park games. It was through Beamer's persistent leadership style and ongoing contributions that the community managed to hold together even through a steady decline in member activity in the last years of SPG.</span></p><small>Games</small><a class="fw-light" href="games/cartman%27s_adventure_4.html" style="padding-left:13px;">

He also ran the popular Tech website&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990208005123/http://lockergnome.com/">Lockergnome</a>.&nbsp; It should be noted that while his work was much appreciated, he was never actually involved in the community.&nbsp; Chris, if you're reading this, thank you!</p><small>Sprites</small><a class="fw-light" style="padding-left:13px;" href="pirillo.html">

However, he was later forgiven due to his atonements through his contributions, usually in the forms of spritesheets and SPGtv shows, along with some relatively unknown games. These days creates YouTube Poops and Hitler Rants Parodies with the handle WonkyTonkBotty, and sometimes makes Macromedia Flash animations often under the influence of heavy metal music and cheap alcohol.</span></p>

                <p>I can’t make games like I used to—but I have my ways. One trick is to tell stories that don’t go anywhere like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So, I tied an onion to my belt which was the style at the time.</p>
                <p>Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel. And in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on ‘em. ‘Give me five bees for a quarter,’ you’d say. Now, where were we? Oh, yeah! The important thing was that I had an onion on my belt which was the style at the time. They didn’t have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones.</p><small>Games</small><a class="fw-light" href="games/pocii.html" style="padding-left:13px;">

                <p>Yeah, yeah, we know, you're here because you played South Park Mario Bros., amazing games, we all agree, but that wasn't even Joe's best work. Be sure to try his Kennys games, the sequel had a level editor! If you're into side scrolling beat 'em ups, then South Park Arcade 1 through 3.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Joe was a technician of the South Park Gaming world, every game was a hit and really stood out from the crowd. If you look him up, he never stopped creating games, in 2015 he created a Commodore 64.</p><small>Games</small><a class="fw-light" href="games/sp_supermariobros2.html" style="padding-left:13px;">

                <p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">RFI was a lurker in the early years of the South Park Gaming community citing he was too young to know about messageboards at the end of the 1990s. Despite this, his early games (created under the name Xplicit) managed to make their way into the community where they were shared on various websites. In 2002, with the help of Beamer, RFI was initiated into the community where he became a prominent contributor showing promising style in his games. He also contributed several MIDIs to other game developers and became administrator for the SPG Archives website in 2006 until 2008.</span></p><small>Games</small><a class="fw-light" href="games/touched.html" style="padding-left:13px;">

            <div class="col-md-8"><strong>Shade</strong>
                <p>Shade, SPG's sole representative from the crime-ridden streets of deepest darkest Africa, stumbled upon the fledgling community sometime in the very VERY late 90's and became acquainted with many of the OG game-makers. Despite the eternal shame of never having a released a South Park Game Shade was highly active behind the scenes, helping out fellow game makers with graphics, testing and feedback as well as being the go-to guy for artwork, churning out high quality commissions for lowest prices ( just enough to cover the costs of cigarettes and beer).</p>
                <p>Shade remained on the fringes of the scattered community through several failed reboots waiting patiently for Commander Stan 3 to be released&nbsp; (feel free to add something of your own to spice it up) (RFI failed to remove that last part)</p><small>Games</small><a class="fw-light" href="coming_soon.html" style="padding-left:13px;">

                <p>Back in the day, he was one of the leading officers of Angels of Retribution, an active guild in World of Warcraft and even played with SPG Admin RFI and his friends despite Smacko being Alliance Scum.</p>

He now goes by the handle Bofu and does software QA work, freelance music arranging and composition, and makes Doom WADs in his spare time. He will be the first to tell you that his old games were full of jank, and if he still had the source files, he'd stop being so lazy and fix them.</p>
                <p>He still is really active in music and even did work on some indie albums as part of a band. Did you know that he owns so many musical instruments that it's actually illegal in some places? He has to smuggle them in gun cases to cross state lines.</p><small>Games</small><a class="fw-light" href="https://youtu.be/RVavtP7ACSI?si=2iP789c2KKSadiKE" style="padding-left:13px;">
